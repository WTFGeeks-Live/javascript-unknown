**Task** 	<br>

Variables named firstInteger, firstDecimal, and firstString are declared for you in the editor below. You must use the + operator to perform the following sequence of operations:

2. Convert secondDecimal to a floating-point number (Number type), then sum it with firstDecimal and print the result on a new line using `console.log`.
3. Print the concatenation of firstString and secondString on a new line using `console.log`. Note that firstString *must* be printed first.
