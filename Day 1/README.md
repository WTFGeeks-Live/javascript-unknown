**Day 1: Arithmetic Operators** <br>

**Task** <br>

Complete the following functions in the editor below:

1. `getArea(length, width)`: Calculate and return the *area* of a rectangle having sides length and width. 
2. `getPerimeter(length, width)`: Calculate and return the *perimeter* of a rectangle having sides length and width.

The values returned by these functions are printed to stdout by locked stub code in the editor.

<br>**Day 1: Functions** <br>

**Task** <br>

Implement a function named *factorial* that has one parameter: an integer, n. It must return the value of n! (i.e., n factorial).

<br>**Day 1: Let and Const** <br>

**Task**<br>

1. Declare a *constant variable*,PI, and assign it the value *Math.PI*. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named `PI` (uppercase).
2. Read a number, r, denoting the radius of a circle from stdin. 
3. Use PI and r to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle having radius r. 
4. Print area as the first line of output and print perimeter as the second line of output.
