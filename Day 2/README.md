**Day 2: Conditional Statements: If-Else** <br>

**Task**

Complete the `getGrade(score)` function in the editor. It has one parameter: an integer, score, denoting the number of points Julia earned on an exam. It must return the letter corresponding to her grade according to the following rules:

- If 25 < score <= 30, then grade = A.
- If 20 < score <= 25, then grade = B.
- If 15 < score <= 20, then grade = C.
- If 10 < score <= 15, then grade = D.
- If 5 < score <= 10, then grade = E.
- If 0 <= score <= 5, then grade = F.

**Task** <br>

Complete the `getLetter(s)` function in the editor. It has one parameter: a string, s, consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., `a` through `z`). It must return `A`, `B`, `C`, or `D` depending on the following criteria:

- If the first character in string s is in the set {a, e, i, o, u}, then return `A`.
- If the first character in string s is in the set {b, c, d, f, g}, then return `B`.
- If the first character in string s is in the set {h, j, k, l, m}, then return `C`.
- If the first character in string s is in the set {n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z}, then return `D`.

<br>**Day 2: Loops** <br>

**Task**<br>

Complete the *vowelsAndConsonants* function in the editor below. It has one parameter, a string, s, consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., `a` through `z`). The function must do the following:

1. First, print each *vowel* in s on a new line. The English vowels are _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, and _u_, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in s.
2. Second, print each *consonant* (i.e., non-vowel) in s on a new line in the same order as it appeared in s.
