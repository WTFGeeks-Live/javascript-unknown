**Day 2: Conditional Statements: If-Else** <br>

**Task**

Complete the `getGrade(score)` function in the editor. It has one parameter: an integer, score, denoting the number of points Julia earned on an exam. It must return the letter corresponding to her grade according to the following rules:

- If 25 < score <= 30, then grade = A.
- If 20 < score <= 25, then grade = B.
- If 15 < score <= 20, then grade = C.
- If 10 < score <= 15, then grade = D.
- If 5 < score <= 10, then grade = E.
- If 0 <= score <= 5, then grade = F.
