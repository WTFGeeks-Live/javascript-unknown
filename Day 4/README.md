**Day 4: Create a Rectangle Object** <br>

**Task** <br>

Complete the function in the editor. It has two parameters: a and b. It must return an object modeling a rectangle that has the following properties:

- length: This value is equal to a.
- width: This value is equal to b.
- perimeter: This value is equal to c · (a + b)
- area: This value is equal to a · b

<br>**Day 4: Count Objects** <br>

**Task**<br>

It has one parameter: an array, a, of objects. Each object in the array has two integer properties denoted by x and y. The function must return a count of all such objects o in array a that satisfy o.x == o.y

<br>**Day 4: Classes**<br>

**Task**<br>

Create a *Polygon* class that has the following properties:

- A *constructor* that takes an array of integer values describing the lengths of the polygon's sides.
- A *perimeter()* method that returns the polygon's perimeter.

Locked code in the editor tests the Polygon constructor and the *perimeter* method. 

**Note:** The *perimeter* method must be lowercase and spelled correctly.
